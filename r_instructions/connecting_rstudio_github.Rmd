Here we will look at how to create a local git repository (repo) and connect it to an RStudio project.

# Prerequisites
If you have not already done so, read the 'Creating a Local Git Repository with RStudio' and create a (free) GitHub account here <https://github.com/>. Note that GitHub accounts are usually shared with others and on CV's, so choose a username that you are happy to share with others.

# Create a GitHub Repo
If starting an entirely new project, we must first create the GitHub repo on the website. After logging into your GitHub account, navigate to 'Repositories->New' which will take you to the page below.

After choosing a repository name selecting 'Create repository', your empty repo (except perhaps for a README file) will appear as below.

# Cloning a GitHub Repo with RStudio
Now in order to link and clone a GitHub repo to RStudio we first navigate to the repo on GitHub and select the 'Code' drop down (see below). Here you will be presented with an HTTPS link which you should copy.

We now move back to RStudio and got to 'File->New Project->Version Control->Git' (see below)

Now simply paste the HTTPS link we copied from GitHub into the Repository URL field and select 'Create Project'.

After buffering, RStudio will open a new project and you should see the files from the GitHub repo appear in the files and git tabs.

# Inviting Collaborators
Before others can begin to commit/push code to your GitHub repo, you must invite them as collaborators. To do this, go to your repository page on the GitHub website and navigate to 'Settings->Collaborators'.

GitHub may then prompt you to do 2-factor authentication. After this you will see the option to add collaborators. Now just enter the email address to their GitHub and ensure you give them both read and write access. GitHub will then send them an invite.

If the collaborators are using RStudio, then they should now follow the steps in section 3 for cloning the repo.

# Keeping Your Local Repo Up to Date (Pulling)
Now that you have cloned the repo and invited others to collaborate, modifying, committing, branching and merging files is the same as when using git locally. 
However, because we are sharing the repo with others through GitHub, it is possible that the cloned repo becomes out of sync with the GitHub repo due to others making changes. If you make local commits on an out of date version of the repo and then try to push your changes to GitHub, you may cause a conflict (see later section). In this case git will insist that you make your repo up to date before incorporating your changes. This is known as 'Pulling' - which is essentially just syncing your local repo with the GitHub repo. You should do this often to ensure your local repo is up to date. 
For example, in the test repo I created in the previous section, I have added an R file on GitHub (see below).

Because this file was created and committed directly on GitHub, it won't appear in my cloned repo unless I do a Pull. To do this, simply click on the 'Pull' button in the 'Git' tab of RStudio. This will then sync with GitHub and notify you of any changes that have been made to you local repo. In my case, 'main.R' will now appear in my files.

# Adding Changes to the Shared Repo (Pushing)
Once you have Pulled from GitHub and committed your changes, you must now 'Push' your changes. This uploads any changes made locally to the GitHub repo so that others can pick them up when they make a Pull request. To Push, simply select the 'Push' button in the Git panel.

# Dealing with Conflicts (Merging)
Merge conflicts usually occur when you want to push changes you have made locally to GitHub but your local repo has become out of sync. This means that there are commits present on GitHub which are not present on your local repo. In this case git will insist that you do first make a Pull request to merge your changes with those already on GitHub.
In some cases merging these conflicts is easy and git will do it for you. For example, if the only differences are a collection of completely new files, then there is no issue because they can't possibly affect anything. Or if the code you are changing is completely separate from the changes on GitHub, then git may also merge this automatically. 
However, in some cases it may be that your changes are relying on code that has been removed on GitHub. In cases like this, there is no one way to fix the problem and it must be treated on a case by case basis. Generally, you want to first incorporate any changes that have been made on GitHub, then begin to modify your changes to work on top of this. 

# Some things to try
1. Create a GitHub repo and invite some of the people around you as collaborators. 
2. Have a go at Pulling/Pushing your own files to the GitHub repo. 
3. Each try to Push your changes to the same file at the same time. This should create merge conflicts which you will need to resolve.
4. Try creating and working on your own branches and then merging again with the master branch.
